Welp. I swore I would if progress wasnt made. so here we are

install https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT or https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT 
 
pick a hugging face model hf like https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-7B-1.1-HF [ggml work pretty well]
 
then download polivilas UnrealEngineSDKGeneratormaster [this specific version worked in visual studio
 
copy the pattern and ask the ai to find the pattern for you. then past your offset.

https://github.com/CodeRedModding/CodeRed-Generator/ [possible future tool not in use]

https://github.com/polivilas/UnrealEngineSDKGenerator [you want this one for sdk]

You need Visual Studio 2022 version 17.6.2
you then go to tools and extensions and add tools 141/142/143. I just searched the installer for these. you will probably need 2019 to install the specific tool. [I got too frustrated for this part to documnent my success]
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56901371/how-to-install-v142-build-tools-in-visual-studio [this helped to figure out the setup]

DO NOT RETARGET SOLUTION. this code is very specific.


on the contrary, on VS 2017, when opening the solution/project created with VS2019 (platform toolset v142),to allow it to work, I need to "downgrade" it to the platform v141. To do that, I right clic on the project (not the solution) and choose properties, then "general" and look for "platform toolset" that i set to "Visual studio 2017 (v141)" and then i can compile again without errors.

the property panel to set the correct platform toolset

I needed toolset 141

then follow this guide: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/unreal-3-engine/71911-thefeckless-ue3-sdk-generator.html
you are matching a pattern not the specific numbers on a per game scenario. this part isnt exactly easy or straight forward.

what can we do now: https://github.com/UE-Explorer/UE-Explorer

https://github.com/UE-Explorer/UE-Explorer/issues/35
It appears that version 860/002 is compatible, but UE Explorer does not auto-detect that version as a Hawken package; setting the version manually however does not fix the issue (strange!)

[probably has something to do with our missing puzzle piece] [this is a hunch and may just be a redherring?]
