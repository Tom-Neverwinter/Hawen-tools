Welp. I swore I would if progress wasnt made. so here we are

https://github.com/CodeRedModding/CodeRed-Generator/ [possible future tool not in use]

https://github.com/polivilas/UnrealEngineSDKGenerator [you want this one for sdk]

You need Visual Studio 2022 version 17.6.2
you then go to tools and extensions and add tools 141/142/143. I just searched the installer for these. you will probably need 2019 to install the specific tool. [I got too frustrated for this part to documnent my success]
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56901371/how-to-install-v142-build-tools-in-visual-studio [this helped to figure out the setup]

I needed toolset 141

then follow this guide: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/unreal-3-engine/71911-thefeckless-ue3-sdk-generator.html
you are matching a pattern not the specific numbers on a per game scenario. this part isnt exactly easy or straight forward.
